@interface Match : NSObject
// now that i'm trying to implement this, i have realized i have no real idea of what information i should store in here... i'm not sure if a match should have the cards being matched in it, just the number of cards being matched and truity of the match, the score of the match, or what. We can discuss this in person on wed.
